## Dependencies

You must have `libarchive`, 3.2.0 or newer, properly installed on your
system in order to use this. If building on *nix and Windows GNU
systems, `pkg-config` is used to locate the `libarchive`; on Windows
MSVC, `vcpkg` will be used to locating the `libarchive`.

The minimum supported Rust version is 1.49.

## Features

This crate is capable of extracting:

* compressed files
* archive files
* single file from an archive

For example, to extract an archive file it is as simple as:

```rust
use compress_tools::*;
use std::fs::File;
use std::path::Path;

let mut source = File::open("tree.tar.gz")?;
let dest = Path::new("/tmp/dest");

uncompress_archive(&mut source, &dest, Ownership::Preserve)?;
```
